# SimpleJson

This fork of SimpleJson adds support for:
- Serialization of structs
- Serialization of private fields and properties
- Serialization of DateTime and DateTimeOffset with multiple ISO formats
- Custom casing and naming implementations. It provides extension methods ToJson and FromJson with casing and visibility choices, and users can implement their own strategies for custom serialization.
